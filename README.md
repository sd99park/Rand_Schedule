# Scheduler

Over the summer of 2020, I was a lifeguard, at my job the manager who created the 
schedule never did a very good job at it. She would schedule her favorites for 50-60 
hours a week, while everyone else got stuck with 20 hour weeks. This drove me crazy 
and so I decided to build a scheduling program that took in names of employees, and 
days that they had asked off, to turn it into an even, randomized schedule where no 
one drew the short straw due to bias.

It was written in python and takes a .txt file as the input. Currently the program 
is still under development but the logic behind everything has been finished. the 
output of this program is still in the terminal, but I have plans to add a front 
end with Django to make this more user friendly.

# Todo List

-Create a Django front end
-Fix bugs as they are found
-Change to a bi-weekly schedule rather than weekly
-Add a database with login and schedule data stored per user
